Simple telemetry web app
========================
To run the app, go the `public` directory and run `php -S localhost:3000`.

The app will be available via `http://localhost:3000`.

Available endpoints
-------------------

* **/save/{app_id}/{action_name}** - saves the action for app id
* index page allows you to see list of registered apps

Apps and their actions are registered automatically at the moment.

---------------

- go to `docker` folder
- run `docker-compose up -d --build`
- go to `http://localhost:3000`


Plan
----
* ~~migrate to Docker so anyone can easily run it~~
* registration/login for users
* each user should have ability to register an app
* use generated token for app identification
* more charts with time view
